# social4git: Non-federated decentralized social media

Briefly, this is a decentralized version of Twitter that does not use federation.

Every user stores their application state in a git repo they own and control. No other infrastructure is necessary!

You use the application using a client. We have a command-line client for now.

## Install and use

All you need to do is read this short [walkthrough](doc/walkthrough.sh).

## You are not alone

We keep a [directory](doc/directory.md) of users who want to be followed. Feel free to grant their wish.

## Going forward

This is a proof-of-concept, but quite capable at it.

There's a lot we hope to materialize soon:
- mobile client
- liking
- verifiable posting
- track a Twitter timeline
- analytics
  - who are my followers
  - what is the impact of my posts

## Who's behind this

social4git is the little sister of [gov4git](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git). Both projects are a collaboration between [@protocollabs](https://twitter.com/protocollabs), [@MSFTResearch](https://twitter.com/MSFTResearch) and [@RadxChange](https://twitter.com/RadxChange), focused on creating tools for [digital](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/articles/introducing-the-plural-technology-collaboratory/) [democracy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/articles/gov4git-a-decentralized-platform-for-community-governance/).

## Help is welcome

We welcome open-source contributions. The biggest item on our TODO list is to build a mobile app for iOS and Android. Please, contact us if you are up to the task.
